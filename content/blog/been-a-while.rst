Notes On Installation
----------------------

Been a while, but I am going to have another bash at this project. With a new type of machine:-

Basically an conveyor belt, for the y-axis, a simple rails system in the style of any inkjet printer for the x-axis and a solenoid for the z-axis. 

New tool, `London Hackspace Laser Cutter <https://wiki.london.hackspace.org.uk/view/Silvertail_A0_Laser_Cutter>`_ Which is lots of fun.

I had a spare night in the Hackspace so I created this so far, which kind of looks like the first picture....
