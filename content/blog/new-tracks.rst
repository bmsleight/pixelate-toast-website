Some times it is best to just sketch:-

.. figure:: {filename}/images/new-tracks/sketch.jpg
    :alt: pattern
    :align: center 

The multiple tracks are hard to do easy in Inkscape, so I whipped up a `simple script <https://github.com/bmsleight/pixelate-toast/blob/master/elevator/laser-cut/tracks_for_frame.py>`_. Which produces:-

.. figure:: {filename}/images/new-tracks/tracks.png
    :alt: pattern
    :align: center 

I did use Inkscape however for the supporting props for these parts, these make a frame I can put the tracks into whilst I cable tie them:-

.. figure:: {filename}/images/new-tracks/connectors.png
    :alt: pattern
    :align: center 

It is all clear in my head how these fix together, lets see if it works in practice?
