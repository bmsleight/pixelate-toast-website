After spending some time with making a `3d model <https://github.com/bmsleight/pixelate-toast/blob/master/cage/cage_im.py>`_, 

.. figure:: {filename}/images/first-attempt/model.jpg
    :alt: Model
    :align: center


I then tried to order in in alumide from Shapeways_ or Materialise_. Both companies found it hard to print.

Materialise_
-------------

This was in parts but to be fair I was printing at the absolute minimum, 1mm

Shapeways_
-------------

As I was printing on the edge of `alumide specification <https://www.shapeways.com/materials/alumide>`_ at 1.5mm wire thickness, there were some defects.

Burn Test
---------

I finally got a model of the master shape in my hands and set about making a simple cross shape to "burn" in to the toast. Set the pixel to a cross pattern.

The adding to the toaster.

    :alt: bread
    :align: center

The bread held up longer then the model. Although the model was closer to the heat.

    :align: center

.. figure:: {filename}/images/first-attempt/still-bread.jpg
    :alt: still-bread.jpg
    :align: center

One the other-side the bread was nicely toasted, but no pixels. **Fail**
