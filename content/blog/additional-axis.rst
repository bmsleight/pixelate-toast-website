Add the x-axis sketch to the main sketch on tinkercad sketch

.. figure:: {filename}/images/additional-axis/tinkercad.gif
    :alt: pattern
    :align: center 


I then had a go at updating `frame.svg in git <https://github.com/bmsleight/pixelate-toast/blob/e4530dca03b74d8417a3114d1ca0a52dd0827aa4/elevator/laser-cut/frame.svg>`_. One thing that is not in the tinkercad model is extra plates to hold the rails, these can be seen on the four rectangles with four holes - top left.

**Error**
Now I have spotted an error, the rectangles will bolt over the middle bearing, so I need to make these one plate per rail.
