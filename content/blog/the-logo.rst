So at last we have a reasonable print, something that works.

I upgraded the "machine" with closer holes and large holes. The larger holes were not much good. (Although I need to test further).

However the smaller holes with the closer pattern worked quite well. Here is the new logo, P T - Pixelate Toast, in toast form.
